# Gear 2 Manager [ROOT]
This application tries to expand the functionality of Android Wear down to standard Android *(in this case, phone)* using system resources such as AppOps, PM, Settings, third-party tweaks, etc.

Application was tested on a Samsung Gear 2 Neo watch with custom firmware Android Wear 1.4.0.2633150 (based on Android 6.0.1, build number MEC23U), so some points are intended specifically for them, I will remove them in the future.

## Функции приложения:
• Configure application permissions via AppOps (in the future I will add via PM)

• Delete applications

• Stop applications

• Change screen density

• Change screen resolution 

• Change screen brightness

• Clear RAM (may not work)

• Reboot the device into different boot modes (Recovery, Download (for Odin, Samsung Kies) or kill Android server)
• Changing the name of the watch in Bluetooth (receiving the name is broken, I will fix it in the future)

• Select the keyboard layout (or rather, call the hidden activity from the standard settings)

• Install Root (drop the SuperSU archive into /sdcard)

• Tweaks (for now these are: Sound when receiving a notification and Pop-up button to hide the keyboard)
